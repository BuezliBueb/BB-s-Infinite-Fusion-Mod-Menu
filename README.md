# BB-s-Infinite-Fusion-Mod-Menu

This Mod adds a Mod Menu aswell as a bunch of Resources that many of my Mods need to the Game.
To Open the Mod Menu, simply open up the pause menu and press "Left".
To exit, press "Cancle", "Right" or "Left" agian. ("Right" will bring you back to the Pause Menu, "Left and Cancle will leave the Menu completly")
